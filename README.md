# NAND2TETRIS_Calculator
This is a calculator written in Java that can run functions such as trignonometric identities, arithmetic operations (add, sub, multiply, divide) and powers using logarithmic logic. The files are designed to be ran on Mac, as there are emulators &amp; compilers that can only be run on Mac, which can be gained by downloading the NAND2TETRIS course & accessing their tools. The specific tools for running this calculator are the CPUEmulator & the VMEmulator, which can be used to run the calculator in terminal or a window respectfully. The program itself is meant to be run on an 8085 Intel microprocesser, an older model.
