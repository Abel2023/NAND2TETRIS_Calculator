# NAND2TETRIS_Calculator
This is a calculator written in Java that can run functions such as trignonometric identities, arithmetic operations (add, sub, multiply, divide) and powers using logarithmic logic. The files are designed to be ran on Mac, as there are emulators &amp; compilers that can only be run on Mac, which are included in the README file.
